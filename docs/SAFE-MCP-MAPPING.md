## Gap Analysis

7 SAFE-MCP techniques have no direct ATR rule coverage:

| SAFE-MCP ID | Technique | Gap Reason | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAFE-T1109 | Debugging Tool Exploitation | CVE-specific (MCP Inspector), needs targeted rule | MEDIUM |
| SAFE-T1110 | Multimodal Prompt Injection | ATR is text-based; image/audio injection requires different detection | HIGH |
| SAFE-T1303 | Sandbox Escape via Server Exec | Infrastructure-level, outside agent interaction layer | LOW |
| SAFE-T1407 | Server Proxy Masquerade | Network-level masquerade, outside agent interaction layer | LOW |
| SAFE-T1604 | Server Version Enumeration | Infrastructure fingerprinting, outside agent interaction layer | LOW |
| SAFE-T1915 | Cross-Chain Laundering | Blockchain/DeFi-specific, outside current scope | LOW |
| — | *(No additional gaps)* | — | — |

**Key insight**: 3 of 7 gaps are infrastructure-level threats outside ATR's agent interaction focus. The 2 actionable gaps are:
1. **SAFE-T1110 Multimodal Injection** — high priority as multimodal agents grow
2. **SAFE-T1109 Debugging Tool Exploitation** — medium priority, CVE-specific

## Complementary Relationship

| Dimension | SAFE-MCP | ATR |
|---|---|---|
| **Type** | Threat knowledge base (like MITRE ATT&CK) | Detection ruleset (like Sigma/YARA) |
| **Output** | "These attacks exist and here's how they work" | "Here's how to detect these attacks in real MCP traffic" |
| **Format** | Markdown technique descriptions with mitigations | Machine-readable YAML rules with regex patterns |
| **Data** | Theoretical framework with example scenarios | 36,394 real-world skills scanned, empirical findings |
| **Benchmark** | No benchmark | PINT benchmark: 62.7% recall, 99.7% precision |
| **OWASP** | Not mapped | 10/10 OWASP Agentic Top 10 coverage |

**ATR provides the detection layer that operationalizes SAFE-MCP's threat taxonomy.** SAFE-MCP tells you what to look for; ATR tells you how to find it.

## How to Use This Mapping

**For SAFE-MCP contributors**: ATR provides ready-made detection signatures for 78 of 85 SAFE-MCP techniques. Each ATR rule is a YAML file with regex patterns, severity levels, and test cases that can be integrated into any MCP security scanner.

**For ATR users**: SAFE-MCP provides the threat taxonomy context for understanding *why* each ATR rule exists and how attacks chain together across tactics.

**For security teams**: Use SAFE-MCP to understand your threat landscape, then deploy ATR rules to detect those threats in your MCP infrastructure.
