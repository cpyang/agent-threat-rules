### ATR First Deployment Report: Eating Our Own Dogfood

We published the first deployment report for Agent Threat Rules (ATR), the open detection rule format for AI agent threats.

**Deployment 1: PanGuard Guard (continuous)**
- 52 ATR rules loaded from npm package
- Four-stage pipeline: ATR pattern match -> Detect -> Analyze -> Respond
- Rules run synchronously on every security event
- Skill fingerprinting auto-whitelists stable tools; behavioral drift triggers automatic revocation

**Deployment 2: Batch Skill Audit (one-shot)**
- 97 skills, commands, and agents scanned against full rule set
- Results: 1 critical, 15 high, 66 medium, 15 low
- 15 skills auto-whitelisted after passing all checks

**What we learned:**
- 52 regex-based rules add negligible latency to the event pipeline
- ATR matches merge cleanly with Sigma and YARA detections
- Cloud rule sync (1-hour interval) adds new rules without restart
- Whitelisted skills skip LLM analysis, reducing cost

The full report with integration architecture details is at:

If you are deploying ATR rules in your framework, we welcome deployment reports via GitHub issues.

### Title: ATR First Deployment Report -- 52 Rules, 97 Skills Audited

Agent Threat Rules (ATR) is an open rule format for detecting threats in AI agent systems -- prompt injection, tool poisoning, agent manipulation, privilege escalation, and more.

Today we are publishing the first deployment report after running ATR in production via PanGuard Guard.

#### The Setup

PanGuard Guard integrates ATR through a `GuardATREngine` wrapper class that:

1. Loads 52 stable rules from the `@panguard-ai/atr` npm package at startup
2. Fetches additional community rules from Threat Cloud on a 1-hour sync interval
3. Converts every `SecurityEvent` into an `AgentEvent` and evaluates it against all loaded rules
4. Merges ATR matches into the same detection pipeline as Sigma and YARA results

The detection pipeline is four stages:

```
SecurityEvent -> ATR Layer 1 (regex) -> DetectAgent -> AnalyzeAgent -> RespondAgent
```

ATR rules can trigger five response actions: block_tool, kill_agent, quarantine_session, revoke_skill, and reduce_permissions.

#### Skill Fingerprinting

One integration detail worth highlighting: PanGuard Guard tracks behavioral fingerprints for every tool/skill. When a skill's invocation pattern stabilizes, it is auto-promoted to a whitelist. Whitelisted skills skip expensive LLM analysis but still run through ATR pattern matching.

If a whitelisted skill's behavior drifts (new filesystem operations, new network targets, capability expansion), the fingerprint system generates a synthetic `ATR-DRIFT-DETECT` match and revokes the whitelist entry. This is the "trust but verify" model applied to AI tooling.

#### Batch Audit Results

We also ran a one-shot audit of 97 skills/commands/agents:

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 1 |
| HIGH | 15 |
| MEDIUM | 66 |
| LOW | 15 |

The single critical finding was a skill requesting unrestricted filesystem and network access without declaring scope. 15 skills passed all checks and were auto-whitelisted.

#### What We Learned

1. **Performance is not a concern at this scale.** 52 regex rules evaluated synchronously add no measurable latency.
2. **Rule merging works.** ATR, Sigma, and YARA detections flow through the same pipeline without special handling.
3. **Cloud sync is seamless.** New rules from Threat Cloud are added via `addCloudRule()` without restart.
4. **The whitelist saves cost.** Skipping LLM analysis for trusted skills reduces API calls significantly.
